# 3b-openxr
unfinished [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) bindings + wrappers.

Doesn't do anything yet, but more or less parses the `xr.xml` spec and generates some untested `cffi` definitions.

Waiting for drivers for the OS + HMD I have installed (or someone who has drivers and wants to test for me)
