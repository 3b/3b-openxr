# 3b-openxr
More-or-less working [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) bindings + wrappers.

Contains generated low-level binding for (almost) everything in
1.0.27, and wrappers for most of core and some extensions.

Tested with SteamVR's OpenXR runtime on Win32 with OpenGL. Other
graphics/windowing APIs aren't implemented yet, but should be simple
to add.

see https://github.com/3b/3b-openxr-example for usage examples.
